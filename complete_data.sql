Well before graduate school, he enjoyed helping and supporting others in attaining their health and wellness goals. As a former collegiate hockey and baseball player, he understands the importance of working as a team to achieve goals. Dr. Matt’s purpose is to not only treat but educate his patients, so they are independent in taking care of themselves. When he was 15 years old his mother passed from melanoma. As a result, he decided to become a health care provider, with the goal of helping others in need. He understands that we weren’t given a health and wellness manual at birth, so he has taken it upon himself to provide his patients with this education. His mission is to keep his clients active and healthy so they can have the life they deserve.\n\nWhile in Chiropractic school, Dr. Matt took part in a clinic abroad trip to the island of Fiji where he and his classmates provided free Chiropractic exams and services at local schools and community centers for several weeks. He has developed his experience working on site at sporting events in Northern California and the Phoenix valley. Dr. Matt has worked with elite athletes across all sports from the NFL, MLB, NHL, golfers on the PGA tour, tennis players on the ATP tour, NCAA D1 All-Americans and National champions, Olympians in numerous sports and CrossFit Games individual and team qualifiers.

We have a toddler and just had a second child, so I’ve decided it’s time to get serious about life insurance. But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

We have a toddler and just had a second child, so I’ve decided it’s time to get serious about life insurance. But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

We have a toddler and just had a second child, so I’ve decided it’s time to get serious about life insurance. But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

We buy direct from mills and manufacturers for all flooring categories, eliminating middleman and mark-ups that are normally associated with flooring franchise stores, big-box home center flooring departments and floor covering buying group operations.

Our long-standing history with these vendors, and a unique liquid position in the marketplace, allows our buyers to negotiate and buy at deep discounts, and obtain goods or special limited deals not readily available to other retailers. Combined, this cost and pricing advantage has allowed us to pass all those savings on to you with products and prices you can't find anywhere else.Whether online or in-store we invite you to experience the Carpet & Tile Mart advantage today!Carpetmart |\n\nwebsupport@carpetmart.com\n230 North DuPont Highway \nNew Castle, DE USWe love to talk!\nNeed help or just don't like placing orders online?

We are proud to be part of the communities we serve, and by doing our part support the people, organizations and projects making a difference at the local level.\n\nPull-A-Part is more than parts in the community, we're part of the community. We invite you to learn more about Pull-A-Part, our recent news, and our current Building Communities efforts below.\n\nPull-A-Part, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, is an award-winning family business serving the do-it-yourself, used auto parts market. By developing a unique operating system based on customer service and environmental responsibility, Pull-A-Part has transformed what was once thought of as "the junkyard" into a sustainable automotive recycling business. Founded in 1997, Pull-A-Part operates a network of 35 used auto parts superstores in 16 states. The company has been acclaimed for outstanding citizenship by Federal, State, and Local organizations.\n\nThe company has made an exceptional commitment to resource conservation, waste reduction and pollution prevention. This orientation allows Pull-A-Part to provide affordable used auto parts to do-it-yourself consumers, while providing high-quality scrap metal, fluids, and plastics for recycling. Recycling diverts these materials from the waste stream and helps protect the air, water, and soil from pollution.

He first practiced out of state for 5 years, and decided in 2010 that it was time to return home to the community that he grew up in and loves. That was the year that he built out and started Loma Linda Pediatric Dentistry. He grew up watching his father, Wil Nation, a pediatric dentist, take care of children’s dental needs in a kind and loving way. He learned from early  on that the majority of children, when treated kindly and  compassionately can become some of the most cooperative and fun patients to see.\n\nDr.  Nation is a pediatric dental specialist, and is also certified by the  American Board of Pediatric Dentistry. He received both his dental  degree and pediatric residency training from Loma Linda University  School of Dentistry. In addition, he received his masters of science in  pediatric dentistry from the Loma Linda University Graduate School.  Prior to dental school, Jared graduated from Pacific Union College and  was fortunate to spend a year living in Spain, to study and learn the  Spanish language.\n\n“My  main goal is to treat all children as if they were one of my own. I  want all my patients to be able to walk out of my office, with not only  having received the highest quality care, but with a positive and  lasting memory of the experience that will make them want to return. I  always do my best to praise the kids and help them to feel accepted and  appreciated here. I try to educate all of my patients on prevention, so  that they can grow up to be dental superstars, and enjoy a life free of  dental problems.”\n\nDr.  Nation is married to his wife Jennifer, and has two children of  his own, Jaden and Jianna. When he is not at the office, most of his  time is spent with his family. He has recently become very passionate for gardening. Growing lots of different types of peppers, and making hot sauces and salsas are his favorite things to come out of his garden.\n\nDr. Janine Tran was born and raised in Orange County. She received her Bachelors of Science in Biology at UCLA in 2013 and graduated from the UCLA School of Dentistry in 2017. During her time there, she was involved in the community, organizing health fairs and school visits to promote good oral health.

Well before graduate school, he enjoyed helping and supporting others in attaining their health and wellness goals. As a former collegiate hockey and baseball player, he understands the importance of working as a team to achieve goals. Dr. Matt’s purpose is to not only treat but educate his patients, so they are independent in taking care of themselves. When he was 15 years old his mother passed from melanoma. As a result, he decided to become a health care provider, with the goal of helping others in need. He understands that we weren’t given a health and wellness manual at birth, so he has taken it upon himself to provide his patients with this education. His mission is to keep his clients active and healthy so they can have the life they deserve.\n\nWhile in Chiropractic school, Dr. Matt took part in a clinic abroad trip to the island of Fiji where he and his classmates provided free Chiropractic exams and services at local schools and community centers for several weeks. He has developed his experience working on site at sporting events in Northern California and the Phoenix valley. Dr. Matt has worked with elite athletes across all sports from the NFL, MLB, NHL, golfers on the PGA tour, tennis players on the ATP tour, NCAA D1 All-Americans and National champions, Olympians in numerous sports and CrossFit Games individual and team qualifiers.

But, what is your time worth? By shopping with a local insurance agent, we can do the shopping for you. Get 10 quotes or more at once! We’ll provide you many choices by shopping our top insurance carriers to find you the best coverage at an affordable price. In fact, many of our companies are likely the big ones you’ve heard of. If for any reason you want to change insurance carriers down the road, we can do that for you – you don’t need to change agents.\n\nInstead of guessing what coverage you might need, you can get professional advice by working with a local insurance agency. Since we specialize in this field, we can listen to your needs and find the right coverage that matches. We can also ensure you don’t have any gaps in coverage in the event you have an insurance claim.\n\nInsurance can be complicated. We try to simplify the process.

Feel confident knowing you’re informed about exactly the coverages you have and what you might want to consider.\n\nOur licensed agents are discount detectives. Let them search for all the hidden discounts so you get the best rates and coverage for your money. We understand it is important you have affordable insurance coverage. That’s why we are constantly looking for ways to get you to qualify for a discount. If you are unhappy with your insurance plan at renewal, we can look at coverage options through other carriers to find the best fit for you.

Business	Technology	An automobile consists of thousands of parts, each of which adds to its overall functionality. Holding all these parts in place is a frame or chassis. Over time, however, this frame can become bent and misshapen. This can negatively impact the performance of the vehicle, and it might even make it unsafe to drive.\n\nFortunately, you can repair a misaligned vehicle frame, returning it to its prime state. Looking to learn more about the process? This autobody repair companyin Melrose Park, Illinois is going to explain everything you’ll need to know about vehicle frame realignment below.\n\nFirst, let’s discuss the causes of frame misalignment. What causes a vehicle’s frame to become bent and misshapen in the first place? There are several common causes, and they include the following:\n\nWhenever a vehicle is in a collision, whether it be with another car or an inanimate object, its frame suffers stress. In many cases, this stress results in bending and thus misalignment. Generally, the higher the impact of the collision, the more misalignment that will occur.\n\nHitting potholesoften results in frame misalignment as well. This is due to the sudden and violent impact of the vehicle’s wheel dropping 2 to 5 inches at a moment’s notice. The larger the pothole, and the greater the speed of the vehicle, the greater the misalignment will be.	COMPLETED	PENDING	\N	\N	\N	f	\N		2025-08-01 14:28:16.466	2025-08-01 14:44:46.828

My father was a Chiropractor, my Aunt and Uncle were Chiropractors, my cousin is a Chiropractor and my oldest brother is a Chiropractor.\n\nYou would think with that kind of lineage that I would know everything there is to know about Chiropractic, and it would be a natural progression for me to carry on the family tradition. In actuality, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nWhile growing up I had very little idea about what my Father did. I knew that he was a Chiropractor and that many people would come to his home office with different problems, and some how what he did seemed to help them. My father was a man of few words, and did not explain to me what he was doing or how it worked. He enjoyed his work and did not want to be disturbed while he was in the office with practice members. So I learned to stay away. My father did insist that our family come into the office periodically to get “checked”. I never really understood what he was checking, but I always felt more relaxed after he was done. Our family was also different in a lot of ways compared to my friends. We never went to a doctor, we always ate our meals together as a family, our meals always contained fresh vegetables that we raised on our family farm, we never drank soda, we always had fresh baked bread and never Wonder Bread, we didn’t have a medicine cabinet anywhere in our house, none of my brothers or sisters were vaccinated, we never had any junk food in the house, and if anyone did get a cold we would rest and get checked by my father until we were well.\n\nWhen I was 15 my mother developed a nagging cough that never went away. She went to the VA hospital to have some tests done to look into this cough. They told her that she had cancer and she had about 3-6 months to live if she underwent chemotherapy. My mother tried 1 chemotherapy treatment and decided not to do anymore. Instead, she decided to eat a 100% organic Macrobiotic diet and decrease the level of stress in her life. Six months later she was still alive and seemed to have a better complexion and a less severe cough. A few months later, she got into a car accident and was unable to keep up her regimen and died a few weeks later.	COMPLETED	PENDING	\N	\N	\N	f	\N		2025-08-01 14:28:16.466	2025-08-01 14:53:54.545

But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

We have a toddler and just had a second child, so I’ve decided it’s time to get serious about life insurance. But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

We have a toddler and just had a second child, so I’ve decided it’s time to get serious about life insurance. But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

After being helped tremendously by chiropractic care following a football injury, he enrolled in the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto.\n\nInitially, he started practicing in Northern Ontario and for 6 years, his office was focused essentially on helping people relieve their pain.\n\nAnd then, after moving back to Quebec, he discovered a new world of possibilities with an approach to help people with their overall health, longevity and well-being; in other words, to help people live the life of their dreams.\n\nAnd so, what is very unique about his practice is that he helps people empower simultaneously all aspects of their lives, particularly when it comes to health and healing so that they can live an amazing life, 70-80-90 years of rich quality health without drugs or surgeries.\n\nIt is such an inspiration for him to educate people and families on how to transform their lives by expressing more fully the potential that they have within themselves to live well, fulfilled and inspired, when the spine and nervous system are functioning at their optimal, for the power to heal lies within.

It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.

After being helped tremendously by chiropractic care following a football injury, he enrolled in the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto.\n\nInitially, he started practicing in Northern Ontario and for 6 years, his office was focused essentially on helping people relieve their pain.\n\nAnd then, after moving back to Quebec, he discovered a new world of possibilities with an approach to help people with their overall health, longevity and well-being; in other words, to help people live the life of their dreams.\n\nAnd so, what is very unique about his practice is that he helps people empower simultaneously all aspects of their lives, particularly when it comes to health and healing so that they can live an amazing life, 70-80-90 years of rich quality health without drugs or surgeries.\n\nIt is such an inspiration for him to educate people and families on how to transform their lives by expressing more fully the potential that they have within themselves to live well, fulfilled and inspired, when the spine and nervous system are functioning at their optimal, for the power to heal lies within.

We have a toddler and just had a second child, so I’ve decided it’s time to get serious about life insurance. But I’d really like to understand some of the basics before I make a purchase – mostly so I know what to ask an agent or look for in a policy. What are some things to consider before buying life insurance?\n\nWe posed this question to Andrew “Jack” Fitzpatrick, a Farmers Insurance®agent based in Irving, Texas. Here’s what he had to say about life insurance questions.\n\nA:AnswerLife insurancecan be a tricky topic. It’s designed to provide financial support for those who depend on you, but permanent life insurance can also be used to access money for big purchases during your lifetime through policy loans.2Here are answers to some common questions I hear about life insurance.\n\nGroup policies provided by employers typically offer an affordable and easy way to enroll in life insurance without a medical exam. However, group policies may only pay an amount equal to one or two years of salary or a similarly limited amount, which may or may not be enough to cover your family’s needs.\n\nAdditionally, when you change jobs, you may not be able to take your life insurance coverage with you. When you consider that, the older we get, the more difficult and costly it may be to obtain life insurance, having a personal policy to supplement your employer-provided policy can make sense.
