## **🔍 Why Your Upload ID Wasn't in Local Database:**

### **Root Cause: Database Separation**
- **Frontend Database** (Next.js + Prisma): Local development database
- **Backend Database** (Python + PostgreSQL): Remote server database
- **Your upload was processed on the REMOTE server**, not locally

### **What Happened:**
1. **Frontend created upload record** locally (gave you the ID)
2. **Frontend called remote backend** successfully
3. **Backend processed the upload** and stored it in remote database
4. **Local database never received** the upload data

## **🚀 Current System Status:**

### **Remote Server (103.215.159.51):**
- ✅ **FastAPI Backend**: Running on port 8000
- ✅ **Celery Worker 1**: Running and processing tasks
- ✅ **Celery Worker 2**: Running and processing tasks
- ✅ **Frontend**: Running on port 3001
- ✅ **All services restarted** and running optimally

### **Services Restarted:**
- `fastapi-backend` - Backend API server
- `celery-worker-1` - Background task processor
- `celery-worker-2` - Background task processor
- `Frontend` - Next.js frontend application

## **📊 Your Upload Status:**

### **File Processing:**
- ✅ **CSV Upload**: Successfully received
- ✅ **Website Extraction**: 2 websites extracted
- ✅ **Database Storage**: Stored in remote backend database
- 🔄 **Scraping**: Automatically triggered
- ⏳ **AI Message Generation**: Waiting for scraping completion
- ⏳ **Contact Form Submission**: Waiting for message generation

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Wait for scraping to complete** (should happen automatically)
2. **AI message generation will start** once scraping is done
3. **Contact form submission will begin** once messages are generated

## **🔧 How to Monitor Progress:**

### **Check Remote Backend Logs:**
```bash
sshpass -p 'aZ9LdgAPsW6' ssh xb3353@103.215.159.51
cd /home/xb3353/Automated-AI-Messaging-Tool-Backend

# Check backend logs
tail -f logs/fastapi-combined-0.log

# Check Celery worker logs
tail -f logs/celery-worker-1-error-12.log
```

### **Check Upload Status via API:**
```bash
curl "http://103.215.159.51:8000/api/upload?userId=YOUR_USER_ID&fileUploadId=cmelge11r000qpy2h0aahoxmk"
```
