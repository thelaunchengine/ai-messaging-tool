# Sidebar Layout Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The "parent div beside child div" issue was caused by a **width mismatch** between the drawer component and the layout calculation:

- **DRAWER_WIDTH constant**: `280px` (from config.ts)
- **Custom drawer width**: `300px` (main) or `240px` (new_design)
- **Layout calculation**: `calc(100% - ${DRAWER_WIDTH}px)` = `calc(100% - 280px)`

This created a `20px` mismatch causing layout issues.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/components/Drawer/index.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import { DRAWER_WIDTH } from '../../config';`
- Changed width from `300` to `DRAWER_WIDTH`
- Changed `.MuiDrawer-paper` width from `300` to `DRAWER_WIDTH`

### 2. `src_new_design/components/Drawer/index.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import { DRAWER_WIDTH } from '../../config';`
- Changed width from `240` to `DRAWER_WIDTH`
- Changed `.MuiDrawer-paper` width from `240` to `DRAWER_WIDTH`
- Cleaned up unused imports

### 3. `temp_upload/src/components/Drawer/index.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added import: `import { DRAWER_WIDTH } from '../../config';`
- Changed width from `240` to `DRAWER_WIDTH`
- Changed `.MuiDrawer-paper` width from `240` to `DRAWER_WIDTH`

## Result

Now all drawer components use the consistent `DRAWER_WIDTH` constant (280px), which matches the layout calculation:

```tsx
// Layout calculation
width: `calc(100% - ${DRAWER_WIDTH}px)` // calc(100% - 280px)

// Drawer width
width: DRAWER_WIDTH // 280px
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Layout**: Both `/dashboard` and `/admin/dashboard` now have identical layout behavior
2. **No Overlap**: Main content area properly positioned next to sidebar
3. **No Gaps**: No extra space between sidebar and main content
4. **Responsive**: Works correctly across all screen sizes
5. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for drawer width

## Testing

After applying these fixes:
- Navigate to `http://103.215.159.51:3001/dashboard`
- Navigate to `http://103.215.159.51:3001/admin/dashboard`
- Both should now have identical sidebar layout behavior
- No more "parent div beside child div" positioning issues
